We are very proud of our school and the accomplishments of our students. The dynamic combination of our professional educators, dedicated parents and community members ensure that all students achieve beyond their potential and become lifelong learners to ensure their place as Global citizens in the international communities around the world. We strive to support this environment by building a more inclusive curriculum for all our children to thrive in. We encourage all our students to become independent and creative thinkers. The Montessori Careland uses a holistic and child-centered approach which leads to all decisions, developments, and strategic planning actions for the well-being and success of our students. We are very passionate about providing the best possible learning opportunities and experiences for all children irrespective of their strengths, challenges, or needs. We strive to partner with parents to develop in our students a deep sense of empathy, compassion, and love for their fellow classmates, teachers, community, and the world. All families are welcome at Montessori Careland regardless of their religious, political, and socio-economic positions. We look forward to meeting you and welcoming you as part of the MCland Family.</p>
